## Simple CLI to embed cover art to your audio files

When downloading audio from questionable sources, or better yet, recording from your vinyl record collection, your audio files won't have that nice look when displayed through your playback program. This script remedies that by looking up the artist and album (derived from your folder structure), searching the [Cover Art Archive](coverartarchive.org) to retrieve the album's MBID and fetch the corresponding cover art (if present).
